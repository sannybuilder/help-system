<h2>Options - General</h2>

  <p class="text">This page contains the (de)compiler options mostly.</p>

	<p class="text">Sanny Builder needs certain game files while working, so you have to choose a correct directory where the game is installed. You may input the path manually or by selecting the directory via the dialog appearing when you press the button.</p>

	<p><img src="img/en/main_ini.png" width="221" height="50"><a name="INI"></a></p>

  <p class="text">The program also needs the INI file containing the opcodes list. You may set the path to this file here (manually or by selecting file dialog appearing when you press the button).</p>

	<a name="lang"></a>
	<img src="img/en/main_lang.png" width="201" height="47">
	<p class="text">There is a list of available translations for Sanny Builder. The translation files are present in the folder \lang. Choose desired language for the program interface in this list. The translation instructions are contained in the file "How to translate.txt" in the folder \lang. </p>

	<a name="association"></a>
	<img src="img/en/main_ass.png" width="199" height="53">
	<p class="text">You may associate different file extensions with Sanny Builder. When a checkbox is selected, your Windows Registry is changed and you may open the files with this extension simply by clicking it. To cancel the association, unselect a proper checkbox.</p>

	<p class="text">Here you see common  options of the (de)compiler.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u>Always overwrite output file</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">If this one checked, the  decompiler writes decompiled data in the output file disregarding if it exists  or not. If not, and the text file with such name already exists, the decompiler  won’t rewrite it but create a new text file with index (for example,  main[0].txt).</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u>Show progress</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">While program executes (de)compiling process and if this box selected, there is a progress line in the status bar. Otherwise status bar have words: Please wait. Showing progress slightly slows the execution time.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u>Show warning</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">This option has the meaning only when San Andreas scripts are compiling. If the game is running during the compiling process, the file script.img containing the part of the scripts could not be rewrote as the game uses this file. The compiler shows a warning about it. You may disable this warning by checking this box.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u>Manual IMG opening</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">When the decompiling process started, the program searches for the file script.img containing some game scripts. If this file is not found in the same folder with the SCM file or in the San Andreas\data\scripts\ folder, the error message is shown. If this option toggled, you can select needed img file manually.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><a name="F8"></a><u>Quick game loading</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">Sanny Builder is able to skip SA startup splash screens (F8). If this ability causes an error in your game version, disable this option.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u><b><u><a name="check"></a></u></b>Check conditions</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">This option has two  meanings. First, the program replaces the <a href="../coding/conditions.html">number of conditions</a> in the IF opcode with AND or OR. Second, the program is  able to compile the IF..END construct, and calculate needed IF parameter in the  conditions with words AND or OR.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u><a name="loc"></a>Ranges check</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">The number of accessible local variables is limited. When this option is checked, the compiler checks the correct using of them.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u>Write opcodes</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">This option turns the decompiling output from high-level to low-level and vice versa. If this option is unchecked, the decompiler uses available classes and keywords instead of opcodes. In addition, there are no opcodes for simple math expressions. If option checked, all opcodes are present in the output file.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u><b><u><a name="mission"></a></u></b>Replace mission numbers</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">When this option checked, the decompiler  replaces mission number in the opcode <b>start_mission</b> with mission name. The mission name is the label name defined in the file header. <br>
	This name also could be used for <a href="features.htm#jumpLabel">quick movement</a> to the mission code.
	<p class="text"><b><u>Insert original mission names</u></b></p>
	<p class="text">When this option checked,  the decompiler adds predefined original mission names as comments for the  opcode <b>start_mission</b> and for the  line DEFINE MISSION in the file header.</p>
	<p class="text"><b><u><a name="SCM"></a>Add extra info to SCM </u> </b></p>
	<p class="text">If this option is  checked the compiler adds extra information to the end of the file main.scm.  This info will be used later when this file is decompiled in order to bring it to  maximum conformity with original source. The following data is added to the end  of the main.scm:  <a href="../coding/hex_end.html">hex..end constructs</a> offsets, <a href="../coding/variables.html">global variables names</a> and so on. Pay attention that the file compiled in  such way cannot be decompiled in older SB versions (except the case when <a href="console.htm#IGNORE_UNKNOWN">ignore_unknown</a> option is enabled).</p></body></html>
