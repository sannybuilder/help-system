<h2>Options - Formats</h2>
            <p class="text">Here you can set up source file names, labels format, and identifiers case.</p>

		    <p class="text">There the file  name masks are present. The upper line contains path and name of the text file  which is created at decompiling. Bottom lines contain paths and names of two  binary files SCM and IMG which are created at compiling. All lines have the  same syntax. It uses special words meaning part of full file name:<br><br>
                <b>$dir </b>– file path<br>
                <b>$name </b>– file name<br>
                <b>$ext </b>– file extension<br><br>
		      Example, if you  decompile the file C:\MyDir\main.scm, then <br>
              <br>
              <b>$dir = </b>C:\MyDir; <br>
              <b>$name</b> = main<br>
              <b>$ext </b>- .scm<br>
		      So, if the mask is <b>$dir\$name.txt</b>, the output file will  be named <b>C:\MyDir\main.txt</b></p>

		<img src="img/en/form_label.png" width="210" height="147">
		<p class="text">Here you may choose  one of the various name formats for the labels used at decompiling.<br><br>
            <b>Global  Offset: all labels</b> will have a numeric  name, for example <span class="general1-label">@12345</span>. The number means this label’s offset in  the file being decompiled.<br><br>
            <b>Thread+Local  Offset: </b>label name will consist of two  parts: a name of the thread where the label is (the name_thread opcode is used  for this), and additionally offset from this thread’s beginning, for example <span class="general1-label">@MAIN_12</span>.<br><br>
            <b>Thread +  Global Offset: </b>this option is similar to  the previous one, except that after the thread name there will be not a local  offset but the global one (as the first case), for example <span class="general1-label">@HELP_34567</span>.<br><br>
		  If you want the  offsets to be hexadimal, select the proper option. By default, all offsets are  decimal.</p>

	    <p class="text">These options  make the decompiler use or not the custom names for various script literals.<br><br>
  The labels names  are contained in the file CustomLabels.ini in the folder SB\data\&lt;game&gt;. This  file contains the list of labels names and offsets (for main.scm version 1.0).  If the first box checked, the decompiler names the label as defined. <br><br>
	      The variables  names are present in the file CustomVariables.ini for each game. It looks like  the list of global variables addresses (DMA) and their textual representation. If  this box checked, the decompiler gives to the global variable its custom name.<br><br>
	    <span class="text">The arrays names list are present in the file CustomArrays.ini.  Its syntax is as follows: the first number is the global variable name (DMA) which  is the first element of the array (array name), the second – array size, the  third – custom name. This option is used in order to decompiler adds an index  to some global variables being an array. So, these variables become <a href="../coding/variables.html#Index">indexed ones.</a></span></p>

	<img src="img/en/form_case.png" width="208" height="55">
	<p class="text">This option has two meanings. The decompiler names global variables, labels, arrays using the selected letters case. The compiler writes the strings in the SCM using the selected letter case also.</p></body></html>
